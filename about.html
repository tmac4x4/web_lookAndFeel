                My name is Terry McFarland, and I'm a graduate student at USF who is currently studying App Development for Analytics. For a class assignment on web development, I designed this tool
                to demonstrate the learned fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Over the years, I've acquired various web development skills during my career at Disney.  However, to show CRUD functionality, I had to do a fair amount of 
                research and experimentation.
            </p>
            <p>    
                It was important to me to ensure that the functionality was actually functional so that I could improve my skills and use this as a reference in the future.
                I had to build my own custom database of drama movie titles that I found online.  The format of the javascript database was something that I had to create myself to keep the design of the page
                as simple as possible.  While I think bootstrapping is very helpful to improve the polish of a website by leveraging others' developments, my goal was to keep things very simple, yet still achieve
                the basic functionality required of the assignment.
            </p>
            <p>    
                The Analytics section is currently a simulation of future functionality that will allow the user to score the movies as they watch them so they can recall their favorites.
            </p>
            <p>    
                There are several technial imperfections with the functionality (apologies if you experienced them), but I'm hoping this shows some reasonable attempt to understand the functionality.
